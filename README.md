# CONCEPTUAL_ERD_RESTAURANTS

**Scope of the project**

This is a conceptual ERD of a database that includes the names of the main restaurants in the city, broken down by its different attributes.

**Application use**

The application help newcomers to the city to find restaurants according to their needs and dietary requirements or restrictions.

**Technologies you used**

We have used Lucid to create the charts, GitHub to upload the final product and Slack to share content and communicate to each other.

We struggles to apply the right cardinalities between tables.
